## Running the integration tests

We expect a folder `~/vpinball/tables` to exist that contains a lot of `vpx` and `directb2s` files. The tests will recursively search for these files and run the tests on them.

```bash
cargo test --release -- --ignored --nocapture
```

## Making a release

We use https://github.com/MarcoIeni/release-plz which creates a release pr on every commit to master
